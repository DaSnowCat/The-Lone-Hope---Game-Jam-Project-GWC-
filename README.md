# About This Project
I made this project for Girls Who Code SIP program with the Game Jam for 4 days. It was engaging and fun. 
This project reference a story from Anansi and protrays hope to those alone. It's a story game with minigames as part of the story that is 
the conflict. There are 4 endings in this game, 2 that are good and 2 that are bad for each path. This is the first time I ever coded a project
by myself.

## File Overview

### ← script.js

This is where we will add the JavaScript code for our game.

### ← assets

Drag in assets, like images, to add them to your project. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg` or `assets/example.png`.

### ← index.html

The HTML file contains HTML code that sets up a webpage for our game. We also add libraries in this file using HTML tags.

### ← README.md

That's this file. This is the place to tell people more about what your game does and how you built it. 

### ← style.css

The CSS file adds styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. We will not use this file for our game and instead update the style of our game in the script.js file.
